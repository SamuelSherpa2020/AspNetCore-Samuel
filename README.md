# AspNet Course From Udemy
- Hello everyone there, I've made this repo public to share my journey & code with other fellow coders who would want to pursue a .Net career. I've taken the [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/asp-net-core-true-ultimate-guide-real-project/) taught by Harsha Varda, who is a master of .Net and a legend from whom beginners to pro-coders take inspiration. 

- I've created each Section folder and inside it again created folders for project code according to the sub-section.

- In the coming days if you'd love to connect with me to discuss the codes feel free to connect with me, i'd be more than happy to explain and teach you.

- The course captures the most basic to professional topics of Asp DotNet Core.

Thank you, 
King-jireh.
